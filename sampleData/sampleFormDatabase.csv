Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,
All felled, felled, are all felled;
Of a fresh and following folded rank
Not spared, not one

Shadow that swam or sank
On meadow and river and wind-wandering weed-winding bank",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.

Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

They shut the road through the woods
Seventy years ago.

Before they planted the trees.

And over lightless pane and footless road,
Empty as sky, with every other sound

In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,
In tempest or the night of nightingales,
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

By Robert Frost
Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound’s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

The trees are coming into leaf
Like something almost being said;
The recent buds relax and spread,
Their greenness is a kind of grief.
Is it that they are born again
And we grow old? No, they die too,
Their yearly trick of looking new
Is written down in rings of grain.
Yet still the unresting castles thresh
In fullgrown thickness every May.
Last year is dead, they seem to say,
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh. ",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.
On their blotter of fog the trees
Seem a botanical drawing.
Memories growing, ring on ring,
A series of weddings.

Knowing neither abortions nor bitchery,
Truer than women,
They seed so effortlessly!
Tasting the winds, that are footless,
Waist-deep in history.

Full of wings, otherworldliness.
In this, they are Ledas.
O mother of leaves and sweetness
Who are these pietas?
The shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing. ",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg
