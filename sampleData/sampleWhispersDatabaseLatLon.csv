By Robert Frost
Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound’s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

The trees are coming into leaf
Like something almost being said;
The recent buds relax and spread,
Their greenness is a kind of grief.
Is it that they are born again
And we grow old? No, they die too,
Their yearly trick of looking new
Is written down in rings of grain.
Yet still the unresting castles thresh
In fullgrown thickness every May.
Last year is dead, they seem to say,
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh. ",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg

The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.
On their blotter of fog the trees
Seem a botanical drawing.
Memories growing, ring on ring,
A series of weddings.

Knowing neither abortions nor bitchery,
Truer than women,
They seed so effortlessly!
Tasting the winds, that are footless,
Waist-deep in history.

Full of wings, otherworldliness.
In this, they are Ledas.
O mother of leaves and sweetness
Who are these pietas?
The shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing. ",http://www.more-than-human-derive.net/wp-content/uploads/wpforms/36-7b8cbc9d1a44f92913427f3c8bbb4216/Kilmer_cover-6eeae84b0f6ba06f67f8e99fb1ccde87.jpg
